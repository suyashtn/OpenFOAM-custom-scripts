# OpenFOAM-custom-scripts

Custom python scripts used to post process data in OpenFOAM. They allow analysis of field quantities, evaluation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and related statistics. The structure of this custom package is shown below.

```
The `src` directory holds the different scripts:
1. `fieldAveraging`     : To average the field quantities in given y-z planes
2. `regionOfSeparation` : To evaluate the region of flow separation in the 3D domain
3. `tkePerUnitArea`     : Evaluate the TKE area density in given planes
4. `tkeStdDev`          : Evaluate the standard deviation in TKE area density
5. `twoPointCorr`       : Evaluate spanwise two-point correlations at specific streamwise locations
6. `trackVortices`      : Track the vorticity centers of coherent vortices

`readers` holds the functions that read the data files generated by postProcess utilities of OpenFOAM and prepare them to be used by custom scripts.

## Prerequisites
The python scripts require the following
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* tqdm

## Building the package
Clone the master (default) branch from the git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/suyashtn/OpenFOAM-custom-scripts.git
```
setup and install the scripts
```
cd <you-path-to>/OpenFOAM-custom-scripts
python setup.py install
```

To install locally for a user, use the `--user` flag
```
python setup.py install --user
```
---
The scripts are based and built on the scripts originally designed by [Siddhesh Shinde](https://github.com/sidShinde/my-postprocess.git).
